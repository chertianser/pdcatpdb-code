To run MEDUSA for PDB:

1. Get drivers for SerialDevice, Pump, Hotplate and Valve, clone "develop" branch
	https://gitlab.com/aspuru-guzik-group/self-driving-lab/devices/serial-device.git
	https://gitlab.com/aspuru-guzik-group/self-driving-lab/devices/hotplates.git
	https://gitlab.com/aspuru-guzik-group/self-driving-lab/devices/pumps.git
	https://gitlab.com/aspuru-guzik-group/self-driving-lab/devices/valves.git

2. As of dependency, pip install all

3. For HTE, $NUM_REACTIONS = reactions in parallel
	Load all samples to MEDUSA, connect all tubings.

	cd ./src/pdb_medusa/
	python pdb_screening.py $NUM_REACTIONS

4. For monitoring, $NUM_REACTIONS = points to monitor + 1 
	Load reaction sample to MEDUSA, connect all tubings.

	cd ./src/pdb_medusa/
	python pdb_monitoring.py $NUM_REACTIONS
	
	start HPLC sequence, input the HPLC data file as prompt suggests
